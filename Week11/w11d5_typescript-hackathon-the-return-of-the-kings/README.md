# Typescript Weather

Our Week 11 hackathon we was given a task to create a function app that used the weather API given to us.
 We decided to tailor the functionality around being able to save and track previously searched weathers from different cities.

 
## Deliverables

 #### Code and Functionality
 The coding should be in Typescript.

 Have a user input field to search their desired city and display the weather information

Communicate and fetch the weather API provided

Have atleast one other miscellaneous functionality

 #### Styling and UI
Style atleast one component using Tailwind

Otherwise use CSS modules

Add animation using a React animation library

## Project Plan

#### 1
Use draw.io extension to produce a visual component tree.


#### 2
Use jira to produce a project roadmap for the day.

Split the tasks in manageable chunks and have more detailed information on how we would achieve each component.

#### 3
Have base functionality sorted then focus on having a clear UI using TailWind and CSS modules.

#### 4 STRETCH
Further polish the UI and have the saved functionality working.

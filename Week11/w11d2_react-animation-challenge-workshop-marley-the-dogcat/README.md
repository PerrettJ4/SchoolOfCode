# React Animation Challenge

## Animate a place you love

- Choose a place in the world you love in your pair, so either decide a place together OR flip a coin to decide.
- Use a React animation library to build and animate a website that celebrates your chosen place.

## Animation libraries

- If you are in an odd numbered breakout room use: https://www.framer.com/api/motion/
- If you are in an even numbered breakout room use: https://www.react-spring.io/

## Show your app to another pair

- At the end of the day, we'll briefly share in groups of four.
- Discuss the differences, similarities and quirks of the two animation libraries.

# tailwindcss

- This project has been bootstrapped with Create React App.
- Run the code in the src App.js file. It creates a simple shopping list like the one we made all those weeks ago!
- Let's set up tailwindcss with our React app using the instructions at: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app
- Use tailwindcss (docs: https://tailwindcss.com/docs) to improve the UI of our React app.
  - For example, try positioning the rendered list in the center of the screen (or similar)
  - Try adding background colours (wherever you think they'd look best). For inspiration on colours, try: https://coolors.co/
  - Be creative and curious, and experiment as much as possible. The sky's the limit!
- ‚≠ê BONUS: Try using one of the libraries below to conditionally apply classes within your React app. Read the documentation to figure out how to install and use them.

# Recap Week 2

Use the files in each task's corresponding folder to complete the following activities.

Remember to commit often using meaningful commit messages!

## Task 1

ðŸ‘‰ Use an array method to produce a new array of all of the bootcampers names which start with a vowel and store in a new variable called `vowelBootcampers`.

ðŸ‘‰ Write a function called `makeLegend`, which takes in a `name` (string) as its only argument. The function should return a new string which includes the name plus the words `'is now a legend.'`. For example, if the name given was `'Chris'`, the function would return the string `'Chris is now a legend.'`.

ðŸ‘‰ Using an array method and the `makeLegend` function, create a new array which includes `'[name] is now a legend'` for each item. Save this new array to the variable `legendaryBootcampers`.

## Task 2

ðŸ‘‰ In the task-2 `index.html`, there is a `p` tag that contains a counter. Using `setInterval`, have the counter increment once every second when the page is loaded.

ðŸ‘‰ Stop the above interval from incrementing after 12 seconds have passed.

## Task 3

ðŸ‘‰ Create an image element on the task-3 `index.html`. Using `fetch`, get a random cat image URL using the following API: https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search

ðŸ‘‰ Once you have retrieved your image URL, display the image on the page. A different picture should be displayed every time you reload the page.

ðŸ‘‰ Create a button element. Add an event listener to the button so that, when you click the button, a new image is displayed.

## Task 4

ðŸ‘‰ On your HTML page, you will see an input field and an 'Add To List' button. Declare a new variable, `importantThings`, as an empty array. Using JavaScript, configure the website so that when you write something in the input field and click the `Add To List` button, a new item is added to the `importantThings` array.

ðŸ‘‰ As well as adding the item to the in memory array, now display each added item in an `li` element within the ordered list.

ðŸ‘‰ Add a new label and input field element to your `index.html` file. This input field represents the priority value of your important thing, and should take in a number. Refactor your code so that, when you click your `Add To List` button, you add an object to your array, rather than a string value. For example: `let importantThings = [{text: 'telephone mother', priority: 1}]`.

ðŸ‘‰ Add a new button to your site called `Order List`. When the button is clicked, reorder your list by priority.

## Bonus

ðŸŽ‰ For the `makeLegend` function from Task 1, **refactor** it to check that you were handed a string - if you weren't, then return `'A legend requires a string'`

ðŸŽ‰ Style your pages with CSS!

# Build a personality quiz with useReducer

It's time to unleash your inner teenager and create a personality quiz, using the useReducer hook to keep track of the responses to each question so you can calculate the results at the end.

To see a visual about how the reducer for your quiz will work, see the [diagram here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAENwJNdEC0/GIou8tOfGdXoUHyxn-PTYQ/view?utm_content=DAENwJNdEC0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink).

1.  In [index.js](src/components/App/index.js) of your `App` component, import your `useReducer` hook and use it within your component.

2.  Set your reducer function's initial state to be an object with a property called `quizResults` whose value is an empty array. This is where you'll store the answer to each question via the `useReducer`'s reducer function.

3.  Outside of the `App` component's function, create your reducer function that you're using in your `useReducer` hook:

    - Remember that this reducer function needs to take in `state` and `action` and return the new, immutably updated state.

    - Implement the following action types within the reducer function:

      - `ADD_ANSWER`
        - The new state should immutably update the `quizResults` array and add the user's choice/answer (e.g. either: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) to it.
        - You'll need to make the user's choice available under the action's payload. (Remember that `action` will be whatever you `dispatch` in your app).
      - `RESET_ANSWER`

        - The new state should immutably update the `quizResults` array to be an empty array.

    - Don't forget to add a default case that just returns the state as-is!

4.  The `handleAnswerClick` function in `App` is where you'll use the `ADD_ANSWER` case you just wrote to update the `useReducer` hook's state with each answer. It's already passed down to the AnswerChoice component, and you can use the console.log to make sure it's working. You'll notice that each `answerChoice` has an `answerIndex` that's handed in as an argument to `handleAnswerClick`. So:

    - If the `answerIndex` is 0, you know the user clicked choice `a`.
    - If the `answerIndex` is 1, you know the user clicked choice `b`.
    - And similarly for the other two choices.

    When dispatching, you should use `answerIndex` to include the user's choice (either `a`, `b`, `c` or `d`) within the action payload.

5.  Write similar code in the `handleResetButtonClick` that's been hooked to the reset quiz button that uses the `RESET_ANSWER` case.

6.  The last step, of course, is to calculate the results! In the `calculateResults` function, use the state from your `useReducer` with all the answers collected. Your function should figure out which choice (`'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`, or `'d'`) was clicked the most often and set the `result` state accordingly.

### Bonus:

ðŸŒŸ I know it's tempting, but only **after** you have your functionality working, **then** go into [`/libs/questionData.js`](src/libs/questionData.js), where you can replace the sample text for the questions and answers with your own text.

ðŸŒŸ Jazz up your page with CSS styling and animations. Get creative!

ðŸŒŸ Write some tests for your reducer function in [`app.test.js`](src/components/App/app.test.js) to make sure each case is functioning in the way that you expect.

ðŸŒŸ Experiment with conditional rendering. Can you make it so that the `ResultsDisplay` component only shows up after the button is pressed? Can you get each question to render one at a time? Can you get the questions to be hidden at the end of the quiz when the results show?

ðŸŒŸ If you still have time, keep customizing your app!

- Do you want to add more questions?
- Is there a way that you can shuffle the answer choices in different orders to make it less predictable, for example?
- Is there a way you can make sure a user can only click on one answer per question?
- ...and more! The sky's the limit.

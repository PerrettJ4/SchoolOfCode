# React Router Workshop

Visit the quickstart guide in the React Router docs -> [react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start).

Use React Router to enable navigation between the different pages imported within the App component.

If you finish this:
- Dig deeper into the components you've just used on [the docs page here](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/primary-components).
- React Router has its own hooks built into it; use [the information and examples on the docs page here](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks) to try out implementing them into your app.

# useReducer Workshop

## Task: Refactor A Counter With useReducer

- Navigate to src/components/Counter.
- Use https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer documentation to refactor the counter with the useReducer hook.

## Bonus: Test Your Reducer

- Test your reducer function using Jest.

**NOTE: Jest is already installed as part of Create-React-App. Don't manually `npm i jest`, or it will break!**

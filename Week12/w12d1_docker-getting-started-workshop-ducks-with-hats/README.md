# 🐋 Getting Started with Docker 🐋

You've just learned about running your code in a container to ensure it has all the dependencies it needs and can run anywhere. Let's try it out now by starting our journey through Docker's Get Started tutorial. 

👉 Navigate to the guide here: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/ 🐋

👉 You'll start by downloading Docker Desktop, so click the relevant download link on the page for your operating system (along with the relevant download instructions link).

👉 Once you follow the download instructions and get it set up (you may have to restart!), run the command under "Start the tutorial" to get going. Feel free to continue reading down the page as well for some more context.

Once at least one person in the pair has Docker Desktop working on their computer, use the rest of the time to get as far through the tutorial as you can.

  It will be better to get Docker Desktop set up on your computers so that you're best placed to use it in the near future. However, if neither of your computers are playing ball, there is an online Docker playground where you can run the tutorial instead. You won't get all the benefits of doing it in the proper Docker program, but it's better than nothing!

  To do this: 
  - Navigate to https://labs.play-with-docker.com/ to access the playground terminal.
  - In that terminal, type in the following command: `docker run -dp 80:80 docker/getting-started:pwd`
  - Wait for it to start the container, and then click the port 80 badge to get started.

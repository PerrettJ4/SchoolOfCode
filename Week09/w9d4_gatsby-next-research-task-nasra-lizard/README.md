# Gatsby / Next Researchathon

```js
if (roomNumber % 2 === 0) {
  console.log("You are doing gatsby");
} else {
  console.log("you are doing next");
}
```

So far we have mainly use `create-react-app` (CRA) to help us build react apps. CRA sets out some boiler plate code and give us a development server, and the rest is up to us. Both gatsby and next do more behind the scenes to help you make the best application you can, but they are subtly different. Gatsby is a "static site generator", while next does "server-side rendering". What do these mean? That's what you are going to find out.

## Task

Build an app in either gatsby or next (see the code above).
Research what it is that it does well.

Your site should have...

- Multiple pages
  - That you can navigate between
  - One of which fetches data from an api
  - One of which is interactive and stateful (such as a counter, random dare generator, or a calculator)

You should research...

- What makes your option different from CRA
- What use cases there are for your option

## Result

At the end of the day you will pair up with another team that did the other option. Share the knowledge you've picked up and understand what the other team has learned.

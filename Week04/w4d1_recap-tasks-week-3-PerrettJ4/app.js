/* Your tasks for part 1: ðŸ”» 
- ðŸ‘‰ Add the code that uses the existing port variable to tell your server which port to use 
(and add a console.log so that you know it's listening on the correct port!). X
- ðŸ‘‰ Add request handlers for your API that will handle requests to the path "/cats" for all the cats, providing the data in the cats array in this file. Test this in your browser.
- ðŸ‘‰ Add code to also handle requests for a cat by id using params and cats by name using a query. 
Test this in your browser.
- ðŸ‘‰ Go to main.js in the views folder, and write the code needed to hook up the button with id 
"get-cats" to show the data on the front end.

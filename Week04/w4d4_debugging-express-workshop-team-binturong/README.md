# Debugging ðŸ§¯ðŸ¦Ÿ

Here we have a jokes API to keep track of all the fantastic one-liners bootcampers share with each other. The code has some very sneaky bugs in it, and your job is to fix them all.

## Order to do things in

- get your env variables and put them in an `.env` just like in `.env.example`
- run the create table script
- send a post request to create a new joke
- send a get request to get the joke by the id
- add more jokes
- send a get request to get all jokes

## Bonus

- create new routes to perform other crud operations
- add the ability to use a query to search for a joke
- create a script to drop the table
- add error handling via try/catch
